			<p class="info">SB19 is finally pushing through with their show in Japan!</p>
			<p class="info">The P-Pop Kings announced the rescheduled date for their upcoming concert. It will be happening on April 29 still at the Japan Pavilion, Tokorozawa Sakura Town in Saitama, Japan.</p>
			<p class="info">The PAGTATAG! World Tour: Japan concert was originally scheduled for December 9, but was postponed. Tickets for that show date remain valid.</p>
			<p class="info">SB19 apologized for the long wait and told fans through 1Z Entertainment, “We can’t wait to provide you with an unforgettable experience.”</p>
			<p class="info">“Thank you for your understanding, and we look forward to celebrating this long-awaited moment together on April 29,” the group added.</p>
			<p class="info">In 2023, SB19 left their agency ShowBT Entertainment. They launched their own company 1Z Entertainment in October, with the band’s leader Pablo as the CEO.</p>
			<p class="info">Due to the conflict, SB19 canceled their concerts in Singapore, Bangkok, and Dubai.</p>
			<p class="info">Member Stell said the band and their former agency have communicated properly and resolved their conflict. Their first public appearance after the issue was at the 2023 Asia Artist Awards.</p>
			<p class="info">SB19 debuted in 2018. In their five years as a group, they released top hits like “GENTO,” went on world tours, appeared on US morning shows, and made history as the first Filipino act to be nominated for a Billboard Music Award, among many other achievements.</p>
