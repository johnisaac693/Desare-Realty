			<p class="info">The Philippine agricultural output posted a slight rebound in 2023 after contracting for the past three years, but still below the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) target, data released by the government on Tuesday showed.</p>
			<p class="info">Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that the value of production in agriculture and fisheries grew by 0.7% in the last three months of 2023, on the back of higher production of crops, livestock, and poultry.</p>
			<p class="info">The value of crop production rose by 0.1%, with palay production up by 0.1%. The biggest increases were seen in the production of mango up 11.4%, calamansi by 4.0%, pineapple by 3.8%, onion by 3.4%, and ampalaya by 3.2%.</p>

			<p class="info">The latest performance marks the first growth in four years after the -0.1% in 2022, -1.7% in 2021, and -1.2% in 2020.</p>
