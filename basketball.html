			<p class="info">Newly-appointed Gilas Pilipinas head coach Tim Cone remains hopeful that naturalized player Justin Brownlee will get his clearance from FIBA just in time for the 2025 Asia Cup qualifiers slated next month.</p>
			<p class="info">Brownlee was named to Cone's 12-man roster for the window alongside several PBA players and Japan B. League imports. But the fate of the Ginebra resident import hangs in the balance pending his clearance from the international basketball body in relation to his anti-doping violations last year.</p>
			<p class="info">The 35-year-old reinforcement tested positive for Carboxy-THC that is linked to cannabis use and is prohibited in sporting events. The development came just days following Gilas' historic gold medal run in the 19th Asian Games in China last October 2023.</p>
			<p class="info">"Justin Brownlee is gonna be our naturalized player if everything works out with FIBA and their decision, we’re hoping to come down sometime this week," Cone said on Monday.</p>
			<p class="info">"Hopefully (the decision) free him up for the window on the 22nd."</p>
